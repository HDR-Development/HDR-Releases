# HDR-Releases
The official stable release channel for HewDraw Remix, the largest and most ambitious overhaul for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

 ### What's the difference between this and the other download page?

 
The other repository is dedicated to the [experimental nightly builds](https://github.com/HDR-Development/HDR-Nightlies). If all you intend to do is play the normal release like most users, you're already in the right place and should go to the [release page here](https://github.com/HDR-Development/HDR-Releases/releases) to download the HDR installer.
If you want to playtest our latest changes, feel free to install the nightly and report any issues you have with it via GitHub issues on the main repository [(HewDraw-Remix.)](https://github.com/HDR-Development/HewDraw-Remix)
 
## Installation
If you are installing on a modded Nintendo Switch, follow the [tutorial on the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBb8jA4WfHA).
If you have not modded your Nintendo Switch before, use [this tutorial to mod it from scratch](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13767).

If you are installing on the Ryujinx emulator, make sure to use a fork of Ryujinx that supports Skyline, such as [HDR-Ryujinx](https://github.com/zandm7/Ryujinx-HDR/releases) (an unofficial build not maintained by us or the Ryujinx developers.) 
You will need to copy the contents of the Ryujinx zip into `\AppData\Roaming\Ryujinx`.

If you encounter any difficulties when installing the mod, please consult the #help-questions channel in the official discord over at [discord.gg/hdr.](https://discord.gg/hdr)
